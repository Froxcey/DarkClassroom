# DarkClassroom
Unofficial UserStyle for Google Classroom dark mode.

## Bug

This userstyle is still very young (only 252 lines of code), so please send me a bug report whenever you find something wrong. Just report them in the issues section.

## How to use

Load css into your userscript loader.

## Contributing

Sorry, I'm quite new to programming, and my file structure and syntax might not be the optimal. Correcing readability, efficiency, grammer, syntax, or pretty much anything is much appreciated.

## Support me:

Want to donate to me? I don't have any donation link. Still want to donate? You can donate to Mozilla Foundation, Open Source Initiative, and Linux Foundation. I'm dependent on open source software, and by donating to them you are indreactly helping me and other people. If you want more out of this, you can do a shout out on Twitter to let me know you helped, and I will be very happy for that (wow, emotional support huh?). Want something else? Follow me on Twitter, Github, and Tumblr. Check out other projects like Mineways. Still want more? Wow you're ambitious. You can contribute to my projects, even by just trying my software and reporting typos and grammer errors is much appreciated. Heck, even this documentation can be improved. Still want more? I don't know man, just be a nice person and that's probably enough to make me smile everyday.
